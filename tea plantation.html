        <h2>Dambatenna Tea Estate</h2>
        <p>
            <br>
            Although the brand Lipton is now universally associated with tea, the Lipton empire had modest origins in Ceylon. In order to eliminate the middleman in the expanding tea industry, which eventually expanded into a global empire, James Lipton stopped at the island in 1890 on his way to Australia. There, he bought a number of tiny, failing tea estates. He valued Dambatenne the most out of all his plantations.
            The factory is still nearby, halfway between Haputale and Bandarawela. The slightly disorganized Dambatenne site still produces tea much the same way it did when it was first created in 1890, with the old machinery and method remaining untouched for 130 years, whereas many of the tea factories in Sri Lanka have undergone modernization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lipton's Seat, named after the estate's owner and located high above Dambatenne, is about 7 km away from the plant through winding mountain roads. One of the best perspectives in all of Sri Lanka, Sir Thomas Lipton frequently came up here to take in the view and frequently brought business partners over to impress them with the splendor of his plantation. The trip to the top of the hill will take around 2 hours, but you can cut the time in half by taking shortcuts up stone steps that are tucked away between the rows of tea bushes, rather than making your way around large hairpin turns.The panorama gradually widens as you ascend the hill, reaching its peak at the statue of Thomas Lipton where, on a clear day, a 360-degree view of the surrounding countryside extends all the way to the shore. I would advise traveling to the summit early in the morning because mist and clouds can obscure the view on most afternoons.

        <h2>Halpewatte Tea Estate</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The factory, which was constructed in 1940 while Britain was still in power, is placed 1,230 meters above sea level in the chilly Uva region, 200 kilometers from Colombo, and six kilometers from Ella, a charming small town in the Uva province. The tea factory, which at the time produced just 20,000 kg per month, was purchased by Mr. A.P.D. Abeyrathne, Chairman of U.H.E Group, in 1970.The factory was recognized as the biggest producer of tea in the Uva region of Sri Lanka in 2008. It has expanded significantly in just three and a half decades, from its modest beginnings with a production capacity of 20,000 kg per month, powered by 15 workers and 2 lorries, to its current impressive turnout of 150,000 kg per month, with over 40 lorries collecting tea per day and a manpower of over 300 workers.The Uva Halpewatte Tea Factory, which is 1,230 meters above sea level and on the way to Badulla, is close to the Halpé Temple. As one of the biggest producers of Ceylon tea, they are recognized as one of Sri Lanka's greatest tea manufacturers. The factory, which is surrounded by verdant tea fields, provides a variety of activities, including tea picking, hiking through verdant tea gardens, learning about the tea-making process, and, to cap out the tea adventure, savoring your own cup of tea.

        <h2>Damro Labookelie Tea Estate</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The vast Damro Labookelie Tea Estate is significantly more picturesque than Pedro Tea Estate, with the surrounding countryside feeling much more pure and unspoiled. It is situated in 5000 acres of lovely undulating hillside 20 kilometers north of Nuwara Eliya. The factory, which was formerly a part of the Mackwoods conglomerate, which was established in 1841, is now home to a tourist center that is relatively contemporary and has a café where you can try some of the estate's teas. The plant can get crowded during the peak season because to its convenient position on the main road between Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, but the quick, free tour provides an excellent understanding of the manufacturing process.

        <h2>Pedro Tea Estate</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Three kilometres east of Nuwara Eliya, in the shade of Pidurutalagala's lush vegetation, is where James Taylor originally planted his tea bushes, launching the Ceylon tea industry. This is where Pedro Tea Estate is now. The factory, which was founded in 1885, was owned by the British until it was nationalised in 1975 and then reprivatized a decade later. It is one of the hill country's most easily accessible estates, despite its plantations and tea fields being less picturesque than others. The 20-minute tours take you through the entire manufacturing process, from grading to packaging, where you will see many pieces of colonial-era machinery that is still in use.The charming Lovers Leap Ethical Tea Boutique, which has a beautiful view of the Bomburella Reservoir and overlooks the manufacturing building, is a great place to have a cup of locally produced tea while taking in the scenery of lush mountains. The Lover's Leap Waterfall, which is nearby and can be reached through a relatively calm 2-kilometer stroll from the Pedro estate, cascades over a cliff face at the base of Pidurutalagala.

        <h2>Blue Field Tea Estate</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Blue Field Tea Garden was established in 1921 and is situated in Ramboda, 20 km north of Nuwara Eliya on the road to Kandy. It is renowned for the high-grown tea it produces on its 193-acre estate, which is 1285 metres above sea level in the misty mountains. Blue Field is thought to produce about 30,000 kg of tea each month. Bluefield, a premier tourist destination run by two brothers from the area, is a well-known tea factory in the nation's rural hillside. The majority of the homes and bungalows are based on English country design. Despite having a population of about 1000 people, 175 families reside on the surrounding 100 acres and have access to all the amenities, including electricity, housing, a school, and medical care.The plant employs 300 men and women, making it a large workforce. Even though the factory visits are brief, they are expertly conducted and extremely educational, if not quite as in-depth as those offered elsewhere on the island. However, if you are passing by on your way to or from Nuwara Eliya, the on-site restaurant is well a stop. Visitors are also welcome to stroll the nearby terraces and observe the tea pluckers in action.
